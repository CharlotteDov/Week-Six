- Definitely a challenging week. Took a while to figure out what primary source resource I wanted to pull stuff from, I experimented a lot with different websites on trying to see which one I could pull interesting data from without too much aggravation. I ended up going with the Old Bailey resource because it was something I had been learning about in my other summer history class and I had an easier time getting the documents using API format and then I played around with them in Sublime to just get it into a plain text format, which I just find easier to work with. I also was able to edit the text using the find and replace tool in Sublime. 
- I chose to filter down the Old Bailey documents to between 1800-1900 and with women as defendents and males as victims with the verdict being guilty. Just interesting to see female perpetrators and how they were treated in court. 
- It was satisfying to be able to pull the info and edit it down. Editing the cases to make them coherent and easier to read took a while. I chose to put two cases into Voyant to look at the language used in the cases.
